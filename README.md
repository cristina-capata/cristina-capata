ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @cristina-capata. Welcome to my git repository! <br>

ðŸ‘€ I have always had this attraction for colors and aesthetic and UI/UX design and Web development are giving me the chance to mix these with technology.âœ¨ <br>
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: <br>
âœ¨JavaScript <br>
âœ¨React <br>
âœ¨Python <br>
âœ¨Django <br>
âœ¨MongoDB <br>
and hopefully I will get the hang of it pretty soon. Soo if you stumble across my projects, I will appreciate your feedback! <br>
