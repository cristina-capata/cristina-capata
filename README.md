ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @cristina-capata. Welcome to my git repository! 
ðŸ‘€ I have always had this attraction for colors and aesthetic and UI/UX design and Web development are giving me the chance to mix these with technology.âœ¨
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Full stack development and hopefully I will get the hang of it pretty soon. Soo if you stumble across my projects, I will appreciate your feedback!
