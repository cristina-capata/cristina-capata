👋 Hi, I’m @cristina-capata. Welcome to my git repository! <br>

👀 I have always had this attraction for colors and aesthetic and UI/UX design and Web development are giving me the chance to mix these with technology. <br>

<p>What do I know already? Well...
  <br><ul>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>CSS </li>
    <li>Flutter </li>
    <li>Figma </li>
    <li>Networking & Cybersecurity</li>
</ul><p>


<p>🌱 I’m currently learning: <br><ul> 
<li>React </li>
<li>Python </li>
<li>Django </li>
<li>MongoDB </li></ul>
and hopefully I will get the hang of it pretty soon. Soo if you stumble across my projects, I will appreciate your feedback! </p>
