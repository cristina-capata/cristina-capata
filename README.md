👋 Hi, I’m @cristina-capata. Welcome to my git repository! <br>

👀 I have always had this attraction for colors and aesthetic and UI/UX design and Web development are giving me the chance to mix these with technology.✨ <br>
<p>🌱 I’m currently learning: <br><ul>
✨JavaScript <br> </h1>
✨React <br>
✨Python <br>
✨Django <br>
✨MongoDB <br></ul>
and hopefully I will get the hang of it pretty soon. Soo if you stumble across my projects, I will appreciate your feedback! </p>
