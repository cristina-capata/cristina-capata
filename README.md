ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @cristina-capata. Welcome to my git repository! <br>

ðŸ‘€ I have always had this attraction for colors and aesthetic and UI/UX design and Web development are giving me the chance to mix these with technology.âœ¨ <br>
<p>ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: <br><ul>
<li>âœ¨JavaScript </li>
<li>âœ¨React </li>
<li>âœ¨Python </li>
<li>âœ¨Django </li>
<li>âœ¨MongoDB </li></ul>
and hopefully I will get the hang of it pretty soon. Soo if you stumble across my projects, I will appreciate your feedback! </p>
